**Welcome to SalekCodes**!

SalekCodes is an open-source personal website project currently undergoing active development. It combines the powerful backend capabilities of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) with the dynamic and interactive frontend features of [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). The project strives to offer a simple yet visually appealing web experience, which will be unveiled soon!
