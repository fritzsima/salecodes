Welcome to **SalekCodes**! This open-source endeavor, dedicated to my personal website, combines the powerful backend capabilities of **Django** with the dynamic and interactive frontend features of **Vue**. The project is currently under active development, aiming to deliver a sophisticated and engaging web experience that will be unveiled soon.
